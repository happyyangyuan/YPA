# YPA
##What is YPA?
YPA is a simple extension of JPA. It helps us create reusable conditional query.
YPA helps you simplify your DAO code a lot. In fact you need to write only 3 classes to fulfill a powerfull DAO:
* An entity class: entity class is always a must for JPA.
* A condition class: it holds all the query conditions as properties in it.
* A DAO class exends AbstractYpaDao.


Once upon a time I was used to the JPA criteria query, only to find that it is rather boring to write repeated query method for every different query condition.
Even worse, every time you want to extend the query method with one or more named parameters,you would find that it is barely possible to make it done without
polluting the former query,thus you had to add a new method to make your work done.Time and time again,your dao class became a mess.

With YPA, you don't need to use JPA criteria query anymore, you don't need to write every JPQL for each query method.The only thing you need is a single reusable annotated condition class for all the queries under certain JPA entity.
The condition class is highly resuable,extensiable and flexiable.
